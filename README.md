# Touch2Win üëÜ



**A simple and fun game to decide who pays the bill or who takes out the trash! "Touch 2 Win" is a small iOS app where the last finger left on the screen after a countdown, wins.**

This project was developed as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my skills in iOS development, including Swift, UIKit, MVVM architecture, and best coding practices.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Touch Detection:** Detects two or more fingers on the screen to start the game.
* **Random Winner Selection:** A 3-second timer randomly selects a winner from the fingers remaining on the screen.
* **Dynamic Color Backgrounds:** The interface uses randomly generated background colors for a fresh visual experience in every round.
* **Fluid Animations:** Clean transitions and animations using `CoreAnimation` to reveal the winner.
* **Haptic Feedback:** Uses the Taptic Engine to provide tactile feedback at key moments in the game.
* **Clean Architecture:** Structured with the **MVVM** pattern and the use of **Protocols/Delegates** for a clear separation of responsibilities.
* **Test Coverage:** Includes **Unit Tests** for the game logic and **UI Tests** to validate the interface flow.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The project is implemented following the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern.

* **Model:** The game state is implicit within the ViewModel, but in a larger app, it would be extracted into its own data structures.
* **View:** The `ViewController` is solely responsible for presenting the UI and delegating user interactions to the ViewModel.
* **ViewModel:** The `GameViewModel` contains all the presentation logic and game state. It has no knowledge of UIKit.
* **Communication:** Communication from the ViewModel to the View is handled through the **Delegate** pattern, using a protocol (`GameViewModelDelegate`) for complete decoupling.

This approach ensures the code is **maintainable, scalable, and easy to test**.
